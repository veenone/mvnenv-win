It establishes the command structure, parsing, help system, and output formatting that all other features will build upon. Using the Cobra library, this feature creates an intuitive, consistent, and extensible CLI experience familiar to users of tools like pyenv, rbenv, and similar version managers.\n\nThis feature focuses on the CLI framework infrastructure—command registration, help generation, error handling, and global flags—rather than the business logic of specific commands (version management, repository configuration, etc.), which will be implemented in separate specs.\n\n## Alignment with Product Vision\n\n**Product Principle: Intuitive by Design**\nThe CLI framework directly supports the product principle that \"command structure and behavior should feel natural to developers familiar with version managers.\" By implementing a Cobra-based command structure with comprehensive help and consistent output formatting, we ensure minimal learning curve.\n\n**Product Principle: User Experience First**\nDetailed help messages, clear error messages, and thoughtful output formatting reduce friction and make Maven version management invisible to the user, aligning with the UX-first principle.\n\n**Business Objective: Developer Productivity**\nA well-designed CLI framework reduces the cognitive load on developers by providing discoverable commands, helpful error messages, and consistent interaction patterns, contributing directly to the goal of reducing time spent on Maven version management.\n\n**Target Users**\nAll three primary user groups (Java Developers, DevOps Engineers, Enterprise Teams) interact with mvnenv-win exclusively through the CLI, making this foundation critical for adoption and satisfaction.\n\n## Requirements\n\n### Requirement 1: Command Framework\n\n**User Story:** As a developer, I want a well-structured CLI with clear commands and subcommands, so that I can quickly learn and use mvnenv-win without consulting documentation.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN user runs `mvnenv --help` THEN system SHALL display all available commands with brief descriptions\n2. WHEN user runs `mvnenv [command] --help` THEN system SHALL display detailed help for that specific command including usage, flags, and examples\n3. WHEN user runs `mvnenv` without arguments THEN system SHALL display help message with available commands\n4. WHEN user runs `mvnenv [invalid-command]` THEN system SHALL display error message with suggestion for similar valid commands\n5. WHEN user runs `mvnenv [command]` with invalid flags THEN system SHALL display error with valid flag options\n\n### Requirement 2: Version and Information Commands\n\n**User Story:** As a developer, I want to check mvnenv-win's version and get system information, so that I can verify my installation and troubleshoot issues.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN user runs `mvnenv --version` THEN system SHALL display mvnenv-win version number in format \"mvnenv-win version X.Y.Z\"\n2. WHEN user runs `mvnenv version` THEN system SHALL display currently active Maven version and its source (global/local/shell)\n3. WHEN user runs `mvnenv version --origin` THEN system SHALL display active Maven version, its installation path, and resolution source\n4. WHEN mvnenv-win version is not set THEN `mvnenv version` SHALL display \"No Maven version selected\" with instructions\n\n### Requirement 3: Help System\n\n**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive help for each command, so that I can understand how to use mvnenv-win without leaving the terminal.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN user runs `mvnenv help` THEN system SHALL display the same output as `mvnenv --help`\n2. WHEN user runs `mvnenv help [command]` THEN system SHALL display detailed help for that command\n3. WHEN displaying command help THEN system SHALL include: usage syntax, description, available flags, examples, and related commands\n4. WHEN user runs `mvnenv [command] -h` THEN system SHALL display the same help as `mvnenv [command] --help`\n5. IF command has required arguments THEN help SHALL clearly indicate required vs optional parameters\n\n### Requirement 4: Global Flags\n\n**User Story:** As a developer, I want global flags that work with all commands, so that I can control output verbosity and behavior consistently.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN user adds `--verbose` or `-v` flag to any command THEN system SHALL display detailed operation logs\n2. WHEN user adds `--quiet` or `-q` flag to any command THEN system SHALL suppress all non-error output\n3. WHEN user adds `--no-color` flag to any command THEN system SHALL disable colored output\n4. WHEN user adds `--config` flag with path THEN system SHALL use specified config file instead of default\n5. IF both `--verbose` and `--quiet` are specified THEN system SHALL display error \"Cannot use --verbose and --quiet together\"\n\n### Requirement 5: Error Handling and Output\n\n**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear, actionable error messages, so that I can quickly understand and fix problems.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN command fails THEN system SHALL display error message starting with \"Error: \" followed by specific issue\n2. WHEN error is recoverable THEN system SHALL include suggested action or command to resolve issue\n3. WHEN command fails THEN system SHALL exit with non-zero status code\n4. WHEN command succeeds THEN system SHALL exit with status code 0\n5. WHEN displaying errors THEN system SHALL use red color for error messages (unless --no-color specified)\n6. WHEN displaying success messages THEN system SHALL use green color (unless --no-color specified)\n7. WHEN displaying warnings THEN system SHALL use yellow color (unless --no-color specified)\n\n### Requirement 6: Output Formatting\n\n**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent, readable output formatting, so that I can quickly scan and understand command results.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN commands list items THEN system SHALL format output as clean, line-separated list\n2. WHEN displaying version information THEN system SHALL format as \"Maven X.Y.Z (set by [source])\"\n3. WHEN displaying paths THEN system SHALL use Windows-style backslashes in output\n4. WHEN displaying tables THEN system SHALL align columns consistently\n5. WHEN --verbose flag is used THEN system SHALL prefix verbose output with timestamp and log level\n\n### Requirement 7: Command Completion Support\n\n**User Story:** As a developer, I want shell completion for commands and flags, so that I can work faster and reduce typing errors.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN user runs `mvnenv completion bash` THEN system SHALL output bash completion script\n2. WHEN user runs `mvnenv completion powershell` THEN system SHALL output PowerShell completion script\n3. WHEN user runs `mvnenv completion` without shell argument THEN system SHALL display error listing supported shells\n4. WHEN completion is installed THEN tab completion SHALL work for all commands and flags\n\n### Requirement 8: Command Execution Performance\n\n**User Story:** As a developer, I want fast command execution, so that CLI interactions don't interrupt my workflow.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN user runs `mvnenv --version` THEN system SHALL respond in <50ms\n2. WHEN user runs `mvnenv --help` THEN system SHALL respond in <100ms\n3. WHEN user runs `mvnenv [command] --help` THEN system SHALL respond in <100ms\n4. WHEN loading configuration THEN system SHALL lazy-load only when needed for specific commands\n\n## Non-Functional Requirements\n\n### Code Architecture and Modularity\n\n- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each command file (e.g., `version.go`, `help.go`) shall contain only that command's implementation\n- **Modular Design**: CLI framework shall be isolated in `cmd/mvnenv/` with business logic in `internal/` packages\n- **Dependency Management**: Command implementations shall not directly import each other; shared logic goes in internal packages\n- **Clear Interfaces**: Commands interact with business logic through well-defined internal package interfaces\n- **Cobra Integration**: Follow Cobra best practices for command structure and flag binding\n\n### Performance\n\n- **Command Startup**: CLI startup overhead must be <50ms from process launch to command execution\n- **Help Generation**: Help text generation must not exceed 100ms even with many commands\n- **Memory Footprint**: CLI process memory usage must not exceed 20MB for help/version commands\n- **Configuration Loading**: Lazy-load configuration only when needed by specific commands\n\n### Security\n\n- **Input Validation**: All command arguments and flag values must be validated before use\n- **Path Sanitization**: File paths from user input must be sanitized to prevent directory traversal\n- **No Credential Exposure**: Error messages and help text must never display credentials or sensitive config\n- **Safe Flag Parsing**: Flag parsing must prevent injection attacks through malformed input\n\n### Reliability\n\n- **Graceful Degradation**: If config file is missing or invalid, help and version commands must still work\n- **Error Recovery**: Invalid commands must not crash; display helpful error and exit cleanly\n- **Consistent Exit Codes**: Use standard exit codes (0=success, 1=general error, 2=usage error)\n- **Signal Handling**: Handle Ctrl+C gracefully without leaving terminal in corrupted state\n\n### Usability\n\n- **Intuitive Commands**: Command names must be clear, concise verbs or nouns (install, list, version, etc.)\n- **Consistent Naming**: Use kebab-case for multi-word commands (e.g., `self-update`)\n- **Short and Long Flags**: Provide both short (-v) and long (--verbose) forms for commonly used flags\n- **Helpful Suggestions**: When command is mistyped, suggest closest matching valid command\n- **Examples in Help**: Include practical examples in help text for each command\n- **Progressive Disclosure**: Basic help shows essentials; detailed help available via `--help`\n\n### Compatibility\n\n- **PowerShell Support**: All commands must work identically in PowerShell 5.1, PowerShell 7+, and Command Prompt\n- **Windows Terminal**: Output formatting must display correctly in Windows Terminal with color support\n- **Redirected Output**: When output is redirected (piped), automatically disable colors and interactive features\n- **Unicode Support**: Handle UTF-8 output correctly for international characters in paths and messages\n\n### Maintainability\n\n- **Command Registration**: New commands must be registrable by adding single file in `cmd/mvnenv/commands/`\n- **Centralized Configuration**: Global flags and config handling in single location\n- **Test Coverage**: All command parsing, help generation, and error handling must have unit tests\n- **Documentation**: Each command file must include godoc comments explaining purpose and usage\n\n## Technical Constraints\n\n- **Cobra Version**: Use github.com/spf13/cobra v1.8+ for command framework\n- **Viper Version**: Use github.com/spf13/viper v1.18+ for configuration management\n- **Go Version**: Compatible with Go 1.21+ standard library\n- **Exit Codes**: Follow BSD/GNU exit code conventions (0, 1, 2, 126, 127, 128+n)\n- **Output Streams**: Errors to stderr, normal output to stdout\n- **Color Library**: Use standard ANSI color codes, detect terminal capability via isatty\n\n## Out of Scope\n\nThe following are explicitly NOT part of this spec (covered in other specs):\n- Business logic for version management (install, uninstall, list versions)\n- Repository configuration commands (add, remove, list repos)\n- Shim generation and execution logic\n- Configuration file parsing and validation (beyond loading)\n- Maven version resolution algorithms\n- Download and installation mechanisms\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n1. All commands display help text with `--help` flag\n2. Version command (`mvnenv --version`) displays correct version number\n3. Invalid commands display helpful error with suggestions\n4. Global flags (--verbose, --quiet, --no-color) work with all commands\n5. Command completion scripts generate for bash and PowerShell\n6. All commands respond within performance requirements (<100ms for help)\n7. Error messages are clear, actionable, and properly colored\n8. Exit codes are consistent and follow conventions\n9. 100% test coverage for command parsing and help generation\n10. Zero crashes or panics from invalid user input\n",
