  "content": "# Product Overview\n\n## Product Purpose\n\nmvnenv-win is a command-line tool for Windows that manages multiple Apache Maven installations, allowing developers to easily switch between different Maven versions for various projects. It solves the problem of managing multiple Maven versions on a single Windows machine without requiring complex manual configuration or system-wide changes.\n\nInspired by pyenv-win, mvnenv-win brings the same version management philosophy to Maven, enabling developers to work seamlessly across projects with different Maven version requirements while maintaining a clean and organized development environment.\n\n## Target Users\n\n### Primary Users\n1. **Java Developers**: Working on multiple projects with different Maven version requirements who need quick, reliable version switching without system-level reconfiguration\n2. **DevOps Engineers**: Managing build environments and CI/CD pipelines that require specific Maven versions for reproducible builds\n3. **Enterprise Teams**: Organizations using private Maven repositories via Nexus who need integrated version management with corporate infrastructure\n\n### User Needs and Pain Points\n- **Version Conflicts**: Difficulty managing multiple Maven versions on a single machine\n- **Manual Configuration**: Time-consuming manual PATH and environment variable updates\n- **Project Isolation**: Need for project-specific Maven versions without affecting other projects\n- **Corporate Integration**: Requirement to download Maven from private Nexus repositories rather than public sources\n- **Workflow Disruption**: System-wide Maven changes affecting other projects unexpectedly\n\n## Key Features\n\n1. **Multi-Version Management**: Install, uninstall, and maintain multiple Maven versions simultaneously without conflicts\n2. **Smart Version Selection**: Three-tier version selection (global, local, shell) with automatic resolution based on project context\n3. **Nexus Integration**: Native support for downloading Maven distributions from private Nexus repositories with authentication\n4. **Shim System**: Transparent command interception that routes Maven commands to the correct version automatically\n5. **Zero-Elevation Installation**: User-level installation requiring no administrator privileges for easier enterprise adoption\n6. **Fast Performance**: Go-based architecture providing <100ms version switching and <50ms shim execution overhead\n\n## Business Objectives\n\n- **Developer Productivity**: Reduce time spent on Maven version management from minutes to seconds, enabling developers to focus on coding\n- **Enterprise Adoption**: Enable organizations to standardize on a single Maven version management tool across teams\n- **Build Reproducibility**: Ensure consistent build environments across development, CI/CD, and production systems\n- **Corporate Compliance**: Support enterprise requirements for private repositories and secure distribution channels\n- **Community Growth**: Build an active open-source community around Windows-based Java development tooling\n- **Market Positioning**: Establish mvnenv-win as the standard Maven version manager for Windows developers\n\n## Success Metrics\n\n### Adoption Metrics\n- **GitHub Stars**: 500+ stars within first year indicating community interest and validation\n- **Download Count**: 10,000+ downloads within first year demonstrating active adoption\n- **Active Installations**: 5,000+ active installations tracked through telemetry (opt-in)\n- **Package Manager Adoption**: Available on Chocolatey and Scoop within 6 months\n\n### Quality Metrics\n- **Installation Success Rate**: >95% successful installations across supported Windows versions\n- **Version Switch Success Rate**: >99% successful version switches without errors\n- **User-Reported Bugs**: <10 critical/high-severity bugs per release\n- **Performance Benchmarks**: Meet all stated performance targets (version switch <100ms, shim <50ms)\n- **Test Coverage**: >90% code coverage across unit and integration tests\n\n### User Satisfaction\n- **Issue Resolution Time**: <7 days average time to resolve GitHub issues\n- **Documentation Completeness**: >90% user satisfaction score for documentation clarity\n- **Community Contribution**: 10+ external contributors within first year\n- **Net Promoter Score**: >40 NPS from user surveys\n\n## Product Principles\n\n1. **User Experience First**: Every feature should reduce friction and make Maven version management invisible to the user. If it requires manual intervention or configuration, redesign it.\n\n2. **Performance Matters**: Fast execution is not optional. Version switching and command execution must be imperceptibly fast to maintain developer flow.\n\n3. **Enterprise Ready**: Built for corporate environments from day one. Security, compliance, and integration with enterprise infrastructure are core, not add-ons.\n\n4. **Windows Native**: No WSL, Cygwin, or Unix emulation layers. True Windows-native implementation respecting Windows conventions and integrations.\n\n5. **Fail Safe, Not Fast**: Prioritize reliability over speed when conflicts arise. Atomic operations, transaction rollbacks, and integrity checks prevent corrupted states.\n\n6. **Intuitive by Design**: Command structure and behavior should feel natural to developers familiar with version managers like pyenv, rbenv, or nvm. Minimal learning curve.\n\n## Monitoring & Visibility\n\n### Dashboard Type\n- **Command-Line Interface**: Primary interface through terminal commands with rich, formatted output\n- **Status Commands**: Built-in commands to inspect current state, installed versions, and active configuration\n- **Verbose Modes**: Optional verbose output for troubleshooting and understanding operations\n\n### Real-time Updates\n- **Synchronous Operations**: Most operations complete in <1 second with immediate feedback\n- **Progress Indicators**: Long-running operations (downloads, installations) show progress bars and status updates\n- **Event Logging**: Optional detailed logging to file for post-operation analysis and debugging\n\n### Key Metrics Displayed\n- **Active Version**: Current Maven version in use (global/local/shell) with clear indication of source\n- **Installed Versions**: List of all installed versions with sizes and installation dates\n- **Available Versions**: Queryable list of versions available for installation from configured sources\n- **Repository Status**: Health and reachability of configured repositories (Apache, Nexus)\n- **Environment State**: Current PATH, MAVEN_HOME, and shim status\n\n### Sharing Capabilities\n- **Configuration Export**: Export configuration (repositories, settings) for team sharing\n- **Version Files**: .maven-version files in projects enable team-wide version standardization\n- **Report Generation**: Generate installation and configuration reports for documentation and troubleshooting\n\n## Future Vision\n\n### Short-term Evolution (v1.x - v2.0)\nmvnenv-win will mature from a basic version manager into a comprehensive Maven development environment manager, handling not just versions but also settings.xml configurations, plugin caches, and JDK compatibility.\n\n### Long-term Vision (v2.0+)\nEvolve into a cross-platform Maven environment manager supporting Windows, Linux, and macOS with unified configuration and team collaboration features. Integrate deeply with IDEs and build tools for seamless developer experience.\n\n### Potential Enhancements\n\n#### Remote Access\n- **Configuration Sync**: Cloud-based configuration synchronization for consistent setup across machines\n- **Team Workspaces**: Shared configuration spaces for teams with centralized policy management\n- **Remote Repository Dashboard**: Web-based interface for managing Nexus repositories and version availability\n\n#### Analytics\n- **Usage Analytics**: Track Maven version usage patterns across projects and teams\n- **Performance Metrics**: Monitor build performance across different Maven versions to identify optimal versions\n- **Upgrade Recommendations**: Intelligent suggestions for version upgrades based on usage patterns and compatibility\n\n#### Collaboration\n- **Team Policies**: Centrally managed version policies enforced across team members\n- **Version Lock Files**: Advanced dependency-style lock files ensuring exact Maven environment reproduction\n- **Notification System**: Alert team members when new Maven versions are available or when version conflicts are detected\n\n#### Advanced Features\n- **IDE Plugins**: Deep integration with IntelliJ IDEA and VS Code for one-click version switching\n- **Container Support**: Native Docker and WSL2 integration for consistent cross-platform development\n- **JDK Compatibility Matrix**: Automatic JDK compatibility checking and recommendations per Maven version\n- **Automated pom.xml Detection**: Intelligent version selection based on Maven wrapper or pom.xml declarations\n",
